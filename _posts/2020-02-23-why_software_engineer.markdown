Resume #1187 submitted.

Check email for any new incoming emails.

Nothing.

Oh wait!

A recruiter has responded but………..they are looking for someone with professional experience.

Hi everyone! My name is Mitzi and the above was my routine almost every day after graduation. Maybe I exaggerated on the number of resumes I actually submitted but it sure felt like I had applied to a over a thousand positions. Having graduated with a BA in Business Administration, I thought finding my dream job would be easy, after all there are businesses everywhere who are looking to hire people, right? Well, I was wrong. I quickly realized that the reason I was not landing a job was because I lacked the enthusiasm for the roles I qualified for or was not qualified for the roles that actually were of interest to me. After realizing this, I became quite upset of how much time and money I had wasted in attending college studying a field that simply wasn’t for me. But like everything in life, everything happens for a reason and as I was looking for jobs online, I came across an ad for a coding bootcamp. I looked into this coding bootcamp and researched all the programs they offered. The software engineering program grabbed my attention because I always had a curiosity on knowing how code worked. Consequently, I researched what software engineering entailed and  realized I had found the career change I wanted to make. So why did I want to make a career change in software engineering?

Well to begin with I always wanted for my work to be of importance and have an impact. I feel that software engineering has the ability of making a great impact on people and companies. Being able to write code that can reach thousands if not millions of people and affect their lives is truly remarkable. Also, creating code for companies and have it positively change, say increase customer retention, would feel truly rewarding knowing that your work matters and that it made a positive impact in the company.

Another reason I opted for software engineering is innovation. As a millennium, I absolutely love technology and working as a software engineer, I will have the opportunity to be some of the first to know about the latest language programs and frameworks. Because there is always new technology, I would constantly be learning new skills, and keep growing professionally.

The other reason for choosing software engineering is the problem-solving involved. Unlike other professions, software engineers have the ability of finding different solutions for a specific problem.What I have come to learn is that you can write code differently from your peers and still get it to work the way you intended. In other words, there really is no one way to write code, and it all comes down to your style and creativity. It’s worth mentioning, that problem-solving also involves teamwork and collaboration with other professionals, such as data scientist or product managers. I think this makes it even more exciting because you can work with and learn from, not just other software engineers, but professionals that have completely different ideas and have a different approach to problem-solving.
