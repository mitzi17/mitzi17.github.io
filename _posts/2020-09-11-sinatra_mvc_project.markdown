For the second Flatiron Portfolio project, I decided to create a simple Sinatra MVC app that allows people to sign in, or sign up if they don't have an account, and start managing inventory movements in and out of a store. This project is an abstract of one of the things I do at work on a regular basis. Having worked in retail for several years, I can say that having a 100% accurate inventory is an impossible dream. However, with the appropriate devices and software we can achieve a pretty high level of accuracy. As mentioned before, this app is just an abstraction of what I do when receiving or returning high volumes of merchandise.
One of the biggest challenges I had with this project was remembering the process. Unlike the Ruby CLI project where all code was in Ruby, this one in particular had everything. It had SQLite, ActiveRecord, Sinatra, HTML, and of course Ruby. From the beginning I had difficulty understanding and following the request cycle. Another challenge I had was knowing what code goes where. At first I found it hard to understand how Ruby and HTML had to talk to each other, and how ActiveRecord and SQLite came into play. I feel that what really helped overcome these challenges was a flow chart that Avi had in one of the review videos, and my cohort lead's study group sessions right before project week, as well as just having to code the project itself. In other words, the key here was just repetition and repetition, in order for me to be able to just follow along the request cycle.
