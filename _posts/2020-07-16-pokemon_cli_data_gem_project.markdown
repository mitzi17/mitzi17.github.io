For the first project of the Online Software Engineer program I decided to work with the Pokeapi database to create an app that would allow the user pull information from a pokemon of their choice. As I began to plan out my app's user story I realize that I would need to have some limitation on the number of pokemons I would allow my user to choose from. Having to display over 900 pokemon names just seemed overwhelming for the user to see, therefore I wrote code in a way that would allow the user to select from a list of 20 pokemons. After the user selected a number from the list, they would have three additional options( abilities, types, and moves) that would get more information about that pokemon, while also giving the option of exiting the app at any time.

It was clear how I wanted my app to work but I stumble across many things that slowed me down  and that put my knowledge to the test. Some things I struggled with was figuring out what methods would go in each of my classes and how they were to communicate with each other. These challenges are what helped me become very good friends with pry. As I continued writing code for my app, I found myself relying alot on pry because I could make predictions on an outcome and instantly get a result, a feedback. Pry also helped me on knowing what information I had available inside my objects at any given time and how methods would work chronologically with each other. Because of my experience with pry in this project, I want to say that pry definately helped clarify the doubts I had before starting the project and fill the gaps in my Ruby knowledge.
